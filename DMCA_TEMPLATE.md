**V. Good Faith Belief Statement**

I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

The repository owner did not comply with Section 4 (Brand Protection and Fork Requirements) of our Contributor License Agreement, which mandates:

1. Complete rebranding when forking the project
2. Removal of all AppWhistler trademarks and branding
3. Clear attribution to the original project
4. Distinct naming to avoid trademark confusion

We provided notice of these requirements through:
- Our CLA.md file: [URL to CLA.md]

- Our BRAND_PROTECTION.md guide: [URL to BRAND_PROTECTION.md]

**VI. Accuracy Statement**

I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

/s/ [Your Name]  
[Your Title/Position]  
[Date]

**VIII. Requested Action**

We request that GitHub:

1. **Remove or disable access** to the infringing repository
2. **Notify the repository owner** of this violation
3. **Require compliance** with our CLA rebranding requirements before restoration
4. **Document** this violation in case of repeat offenses

**Alternative Resolution:** If the repository owner is willing to:
- Fully rebrand the project (remove all AppWhistler references)
- Add proper attribution
- Comply with our CLA requirements

We are open to having the repository restored after verification of compliance.

Attached/Available Evidence:
- [ ] Screenshots showing trademark use
