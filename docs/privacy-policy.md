# AppWhistler Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: November 18, 2025

AppWhistler collects the minimal amount of personal data required to provide account-based functionality and fact-checking services. Key highlights:

- **Data we store:** username, email, hashed password, optional wallet address, truth score metrics, reviews, fact-check submissions, bounty activity, and telemetry contained in the activity log (IP + user-agent).
- **Data we never store:** plaintext passwords, payment card numbers, biometric identifiers, or advertising identifiers.
- **Retention:** user-generated content remains until deleted by the author or removed through moderation. Account data is removed within 30 days of verified deletion requests.
- **Processing purposes:** providing recommendations, preventing fraud/abuse, improving AI models, and complying with legal obligations.
- **Sharing:** no third-party ad networks. Limited integrations include HuggingFace (AI analysis) and optional Ethereum/Goerli transactions for on-chain proofs.
- **User rights:**
  - Access/export your personal data via `POST /api/v1/privacy/export` (authentication required).
  - Request deletion via `POST /api/v1/privacy/delete`.
  - Contact [privacy@appwhistler.org](mailto:privacy@appwhistler.org) for additional requests or to appeal automated decisions.
- **Children:** AppWhistler is not directed to children under 13. Accounts discovered for minors will be terminated.

This draft policy will be reviewed by legal counsel prior to production launch.
