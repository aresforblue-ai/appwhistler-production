## Frontend Overview

- React 18 + Vite + Tailwind UI with discover/fact-check/profile tabs, live dark mode, and fact-check scaffolding.
- Run `npm run dev` for the full stack or `npm run client` to focus on the Vite app (see `src/frontend/README.md` for the full playbook).
- API calls point to `http://localhost:5000` by default and respect `VITE_API_URL` overrides so the UI stays in sync with the backend env.

## Privacy & Compliance Highlights

- `POST /api/v1/privacy/export` — authenticated users can download a JSON export of their account, reviews, fact-checks, bounties, and recent activity logs.
- `POST /api/v1/privacy/delete` — anonymizes the requesting account, clears linked content, and logs the request for auditing.
- `GET /api/v1/privacy/policy` — serves the latest markdown privacy policy located at `docs/privacy-policy.md`.
- `npm run audit:sql` — static analysis script that blocks unsafe SQL string interpolation.
- GraphQL password reset helpers: `requestPasswordReset(email)` + `resetPassword(token, newPassword)` with configurable TTL (`PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL_MIN`) and base URL (`PASSWORD_RESET_BASE_URL`).
- Account lockout protection defaults: 5 attempts / 15 minutes, override via `LOGIN_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` & `LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MINUTES`.
